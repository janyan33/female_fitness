**Experiment 1: Female fitness**

Code for analyses and visualization for egg and hatchling data are in the analyses_markdown files. 
Code for analyses and visualization for female longevity is in the longevity_analyses.R file in the scripts folder. 	

**Experiment 2: Female insemination status**

Everything is located in the female_insem_status folder
Code for analyses and visualization: In scripts folder 
	File name: observations_analysis.R
Code for creating network visualizations: In scripts folder 
	File name: sexual_networks.R

**Experiment 3: Successive traumatic inseminations** (we called this female_coercion at the time of the experiment)

Everything is also located in the analyses_markdown files. 

I've also added the code for when I analyzed Experiment 3 data without the day effects correction to show that results are the same either way. This can be found on Lines 75 - 89 of the female_coercion.R script.
